# OpenStroid

Open-source cloud gaming client. Built with React, TypeScript, Mantine, Vite, Express, and a first-party auth bridge that captures Boosteroid login state from the user’s real Chrome profile via a Chrome extension.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

- Frontend dev server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend auth bridge: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

`npm run dev` starts both processes. The browser talks only to first-party `/auth`, `/me`, and `/library` routes. The backend bridge owns the upstream Boosteroid session state after capture and proxies authenticated requests to `https://cloud.boosteroid.com`.

## Auth bridge architecture

OpenStroid is no longer a browser-direct or credential-forwarding Boosteroid client.

- The frontend starts a first-party capture session instead of posting credentials to OpenStroid.
- The primary capture path is the unpacked Chrome extension in `extension/openstroid-capture/`, which runs inside the user’s real Chrome profile while they log in normally on `boosteroid.com` / `cloud.boosteroid.com`.
- The extension captures relevant cookies plus observed auth/session response payloads and sends them back to the local OpenStroid backend.
- The backend validates the submitted upstream state, persists raw capture artifacts, and converts successful captures into the existing encrypted first-party OpenStroid cookie session.
- The frontend sends session bootstrap, logout, and library requests to first-party endpoints on the OpenStroid origin.
- The backend bridge talks to `https://cloud.boosteroid.com` for:
  - browser-observed `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh-token`
  - `POST /api/v2/auth/logout`
  - `GET /api/v1/user`
  - `GET /api/v1/boostore/applications/installed`
- Upstream access and refresh tokens are stored only inside encrypted, HttpOnly first-party cookies for normal app behavior.
- Raw upstream cookies, login/session payloads, and request metadata are also persisted under `.runtime/auth-captures/` and exposed through a dedicated authenticated debug endpoint.
- The browser no longer stores raw upstream tokens in `localStorage`.
- Session bootstrap uses `GET /auth/session` instead of reading browser storage.
- Upstream 401s are refreshed server-side with a shared refresh lock to avoid duplicate refresh races.
- A backend-owned browser fallback still exists, but it is secondary to the extension flow because Turnstile is more reliable in the user’s real browser profile.

## API surface

The backend exposes normalized first-party endpoints:

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/login/start` | Start a browser-backed Boosteroid login capture and launch the upstream login window |
| `GET` | `/auth/login/status` | Read the latest capture status and establish the first-party OpenStroid session on success |
| `GET` | `/auth/login/status/:id` | Read status for a specific capture session |
| `POST` | `/auth/login/cancel` | Cancel the active capture and clean up browser resources |
| `POST` | `/auth/extension/active` | Extension-only route to read the currently active pending extension capture session after presenting the user-issued pairing code |
| `POST` | `/auth/extension/capture` | Extension-only route to submit captured upstream cookies/payloads for ingestion |
| `GET` | `/auth/debug/capture` | Return the latest raw upstream capture artifact, including cookies and payloads |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Clear first-party session and attempt upstream logout |
| `GET` | `/auth/session` | Validate/refresh current session and return `{ authenticated, user }` |
| `GET` | `/me` | Return `{ user }` for authenticated clients |
| `GET` | `/library/installed` | Return `{ games }` from the upstream installed library API |
| `GET` | `/health` | Lightweight backend health check |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | *(empty)* | Frontend API origin. Leave empty in local dev and same-origin deployments so the browser stays on first-party `/auth`, `/me`, and `/library` routes. Never set this to a Boosteroid origin. |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `3001` | Backend bridge port. |
| `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` | `https://cloud.boosteroid.com` | Upstream Boosteroid base URL. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `openstroid-development-session-secret` | Secret used to encrypt/authenticate the session cookie. Replace in production. |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | `openstroid_session` | First-party auth cookie name. |
| `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | `2592000` | Cookie/session lifetime in seconds. |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` in dev, `true` in production | Whether to mark the auth cookie as `Secure`. |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | *(unset)* | Optional allowed browser origin when frontend and backend run on different origins. |
| `AUTH_CAPTURE_ARTIFACT_DIR` | `<project>/.runtime/auth-captures` | Directory where raw capture JSON artifacts are written. |
| `BROWSER_USER_DATA_DIR` | `<project>/.runtime/browser-profile` | Persistent Chrome profile directory used for the backend-launched login browser. |
| `BROWSER_LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | Maximum time allowed for manual upstream login before timing out. |
| `BROWSER_LOGIN_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `1500` | Interval used while checking whether upstream auth cookies/tokens are ready. |
| `BROWSER_LAUNCH_NAVIGATE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Initial page navigation timeout for the launched browser. |
| `BROWSER_HEADLESS` | `false` | Whether to launch the backend browser headlessly. Visible mode is strongly recommended for Turnstile. |
| `BROWSER_CHANNEL` | `chrome` when no explicit executable is found | Preferred browser channel passed to Playwright. Use a real Chrome install when possible. |
| `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | auto-detects system Chrome/Chromium | Optional explicit browser executable path. |
| `BROWSER_LOCALE` | `en-US` | Locale for the persistent browser profile. |
| `BROWSER_LAUNCH_ARGS` | *(unset)* | Comma-separated extra browser launch arguments. |
| `BACKEND_PROXY_TARGET` | `http://localhost:3001` | Vite-only proxy target for local frontend development. |

## Production notes

- Build with `npm run build`.
- Start the bridge with `npm run start`.
- Serve the frontend and backend from the same origin when possible.
- In local dev, keep `VITE_API_BASE_URL` empty so Vite proxies first-party routes to the backend bridge. The frontend must never call `https://cloud.boosteroid.com` directly.
- For local dev, load the unpacked extension from `extension/openstroid-capture/` into Chrome and keep its backend URL pointed at `http://localhost:3001`.
- Set a strong `SESSION_SECRET` and keep `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in production.
- If you deploy the frontend separately, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the backend origin and `APP_ORIGIN` to the frontend origin.

## Chrome extension setup (local dev)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer Mode.
3. Choose **Load unpacked**.
4. Select `extension/openstroid-capture/` from this repo.
5. Open the extension popup and confirm the backend URL is `http://localhost:3001`.
6. In OpenStroid, click **Start extension capture** and copy the pairing code shown on the login page into the extension popup.
7. Log in on Boosteroid in the same Chrome profile.

## Turnstile / capture notes

- The extension flow is primary because it runs in the user’s real Chrome profile rather than an automated backend browser context.
- The extension can read relevant Boosteroid cookies through Chrome’s cookie APIs, including HttpOnly cookies when host permissions are granted.
- Response metadata is captured through `webRequest`, while JSON response payloads are captured from page `fetch`/XHR instrumentation on Boosteroid pages.
- OpenStroid does not automate the login form or Turnstile challenge. The extension only observes requests, responses, cookies, and page visits after the user interacts normally.
- The backend-owned browser fallback remains available as a secondary option for environments where the extension cannot be used.

## Current features (auth bridge refactor)

- **Chrome extension capture** — the user completes the real Boosteroid + Turnstile login in their own Chrome profile while the extension captures upstream state
- **Server-managed session** — session bootstrap checks `/auth/session` and keeps upstream tokens out of browser JavaScript
- **Debug evidence capture** — raw upstream cookies, payloads, and request metadata are inspectable from the UI and saved to `.runtime/auth-captures`
- **My Games library** — installed games loaded through first-party backend routes with existing loading, empty, and error states
- **Logout** — clears the OpenStroid session and attempts upstream logout
- **Server-side refresh** — upstream token refresh happens on the backend with refresh de-duplication for concurrent requests
- **Local dev proxy** — Vite proxies first-party backend routes to the local bridge instead of proxying directly to Boosteroid
